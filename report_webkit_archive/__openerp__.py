    "description":"""
This module extends the functionality of webkit_report and allows you to
archive the reports to be printed into the file system of the same machine
that is running the OpenERP instance. The directory must exist.

Configuration
------------
* Add the system parameter "archive_reports_path" with the path. The directory
  must exist

* Configure the reports: Go to Actions -> Reports. Two new fields will be
  displayed: "Archive the file" and "Save as File Prefix".
  Select those reports that you want to be stored by clicking
  the "Archive the File" flag and set a name for each by typing into the
  "Save as File Prefix" field.
  You can use python expression e.g. object.name.


Usage

Just print the report as usual. Apart from the report returned to the
browser a copy of it will be saved in the specified directory.
